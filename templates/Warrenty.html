        <p>The original Sennheiser product you have purchased is covered by a warranty of 24 months. For some products a different warranty period applies.

            The limited warranty applies only to products that belong to the time of purchase to the current Sennheiser sales program. The warranty period begins on the date of purchase of brand new, unused products by the first end user. Please retain
            your sales receipt (or your warranty certificate) as proof of purchase. Unless you submit proof of purchase, which will be verified by your local Sennheiser service partner, you will be obliged to pay for any repairs that are carried out.
            Proof of purchase must state the date of purchase and name of the product.<br><br>If, within the warranty period, the product is determined to be defective (at the date of original purchase) due to improper materials or workmanship, Sennheiser
            electronic GmbH &amp; Co. KG or their service partners will, without charge for labour or parts, repair or (at the descretion of Sennheiser electronic GmbH &amp; Co. KG) replace the product or its defective parts.<br><br>Sennheiser electronic
            GmbH &amp; Co. KG or their service partners may replace defective products or parts with new or refurbished products or parts. All products and parts replaced become the property of Sennheiser electronic GmbH &amp; Co. KG or their service

        <p>All warranty claims become void if the product is tampered with by unauthorised persons or repair shops. Further, this warranty is voided by removal or alteration of identification labels, serial numbers or safety labels on the product or its
            parts. Warranty claims can be enforced in any country throughout the world in which the statutory rights of the country concerned are not in conflict with our warranty regulations. No other warranty claims or claims over and above the rights
            stated in these terms and conditions will be accepted.<br><br>Consumers may be entitled to statutory rights in their own countries which are not restricted by these warranty terms and conditions, as the warranty is governed by the laws of
